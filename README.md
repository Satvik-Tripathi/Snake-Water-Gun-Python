# Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python)

A simple console-based game where the user plays "Snake, Water, Gun" (a variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors) against a random computer opponent.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts like error handling, loops, and data structures.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Robust Error Handling:** Uses a `try...except ValueError` block to prevent crashes from invalid (non-numeric) user input.
* **Input Validation:** Includes a second layer of validation to ensure the user's number is one of the valid options (1, 2, or 3).
* **Data Structures:** Uses a Python dictionary (`choice_map`) to cleanly map numerical inputs to string names.
* **Control Flow:** Implemented a clean win/loss/tie logic using `if/elif/else` and a `while True` loop to allow the user to "play again".

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Download the `.py` file from this repository.
3.  Run it from your terminal: `python your-filename.py`

*(Remember to replace `your-filename.py` with the actual name of your file!)*
